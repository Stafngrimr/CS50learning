# TODAY
-Game should spit out the introduction
-Then it should start asking the 3 questions
-Player inputs 1, 2 or 3, anything else and it says Nope, pick again mate
-Picking one then prompts to ask, what have you found?
-Picking two prompts a list of whats inside the bag
-Picking three returns to cli

Extension:
Perhaps theres a big random list of items that it's possible for you to find, and then the program keeps asking you to go forwards, and each step forwards creates a random chance to pick up a certain item. Each item could even have its own % of chance for picking up so that you'd have to really go through the process a few times to pick it all up.

Once you had an item, you've got it. So perhaps theres even a TOTAL number of things you can get, so that theres a type of completion to the game.

What about fishing? Adding an extra option, not just going forwards, but stopping at the nearby lake to do some fishing, and casting the line over and over.

# Today Shit
-------------

Alrighty. We had such a great day off yesterday where we basically just gamed for the entire day. It'd be cool to get fishing and mining up to speed.

That can be laters task. Right now we're going to work on our game. Perhaps even get it to a finished state! Anyway.

Let's make the serious plan for it. Where the functions are going to go. What part of the code is going to be in the main and what is going to be a separate function.

-Definitely do some work on the droplet
-Work out what you'll need to move the website and manage it all yourself

Game:
-make list of 30 items
-write the code.
-leave lots of comments and todos.


-Give intro - just a string and appropriate spaces/line breaks
-Then list the current contents of the pack (3 items)

-Then give the user 3 options
-
