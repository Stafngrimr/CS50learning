This keeps going on forever or until someone enter 3.
Perhaps the game starts with a proper intro.. you're getting ready to go on an adventure and it's important to check the content of your bag, but also to keep checking on the bag as you're adding more things into it.



-Game should spit out the introduction
-Then it should start asking the 3 questions
-Player inputs 1, 2 or 3, anything else and it says Nope, pick again mate
-Picking one then prompts to ask, what have you found?
-Picking two prompts a list of whats inside the bag
-Picking three returns to cli

Extension:
Perhaps theres a big random list of items that it's possible for you to find, and then the program keeps asking you to go forwards, and each step forwards creates a random chance to pick up a certain item. Each item could even have its own % of chance for picking up so that you'd have to really go through the process a few times to pick it all up.

Once you had an item, you've got it. So perhaps theres even a TOTAL number of things you can get, so that theres a type of completion to the game.

What about fishing? Adding an extra option, not just going forwards, but stopping at the nearby lake to do some fishing, and casting the line over and over.

Today Shit
---------------------------------
We are still just able to sit and consider. Though yesterday there was such a great feeling of the day feeling great. This morning we are feeling quite procrasinatey, but we still have stuff that we want to do, and we are slowly getting there. It's just about getting used to being properly productive again. I think we are going to have a day of hardcore coding. That would be nice. We don't have to worry about cooking anything that's for sure. We are going to eat a lovely big bowl of soup for lunch which will be nice and warming.

Apart from that we want to concentrate on CS50, but also perhaps work on the cgame that we've been doing for fun. That's been a nice distraction and perhaps it'll be again later today. But for now we should be concentrating on finishing the randomising of these goddamn alleles. There's a TODO list below which works out quite well for the

TODO:
-Get that final date for the job
-work out the droplet yo ugot. Is it really that good?
