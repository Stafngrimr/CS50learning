Something to make out of what you've been learning so far that might be a bit different/fun and help you learn pointers and linked lists.

Write something where the user adds information to the linked list, one thing at a time. Maybe you're an adventurer adding things into your inventory.

You start with some rations, a potion, and a magical belt.

What have you found?

User answers, the program adds this to the list.

Then prompt the user again but with 2 options:
1 - What have you found?
2 - Check the contents of your backpack.
3 - Quit

This keeps going on forever or until someone enter 3.
Perhaps the game starts with a proper intro.. you're getting ready to go on an adventure and it's important to check the content of your bag, but also to keep checking on the bag as you're adding more things into it.



-Game should spit out the introduction
-Then it should start asking the 3 questions
-Player inputs 1, 2 or 3, anything else and it says Nope, pick again mate
-Picking one then prompts to ask, what have you found?
-Picking two prompts a list of whats inside the bag
-Picking three returns to cli
