						<p>I was <mark>Queen</mark> of England from 1533 to 1536, as the second wife of King Henry VIII. The circumstances of my marriage and of my execution by beheading for treason and other charges made my a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that marked the start of the English Reformation. I was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, and was educated in the Netherlands and France, largely as a maid of honour to <mark>Queen</mark> Claude of France. I returned to England in early 1522, to marry my Irish cousin James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond; the marriage plans were broken off, and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon.</p>
						<p>Early in 1523, I was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy, son of Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken off when the Earl refused to support their engagement. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey refused the match in January 1524 and I was sent home to Hever Castle. In February or March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of I. She resisted his attempts to seduce my, refusing to become his mistress, as my sister Mary had previously been. Henry soon focused his desires on annulling his marriage to Catherine so he would be free to marry me. Wolsey failed to obtain an annulment of Henry's marriage from Pope Clement VII and, in 1529â€“30, I helped bring about his downfall and his death. When it became clear that Clement would not annul the marriage, Henry and his advisers, such as Thomas Cromwell, began the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England and closing the monasteries and the nunneries. In 1532, Henry made me the Marquess of Pembroke.</p>
						<p>Henry and I formally married on 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. On 23 May 1533, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared our marriage valid. Shortly afterwards, Clement excommunicated Henry and Cranmer. As a result of this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and the Catholic Church took place, and the king took control of the Church of England. I was crowned <mark>Queen</mark> of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September, she gave birth to the future <mark>Queen</mark> Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. I subsequently had three miscarriages and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour. In order to marry Seymour, Henry had to find reasons to end the marriage to me.</p>
						<p>Henry VIII had me investigated for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May, she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers, including Henry Percy, my former betrothed, and my uncle Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk; she was convicted on 15 May and beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against my, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing.</p>
						<p>After my daughter, Elizabeth, was crowned as <mark>Queen</mark> in 1558, I became venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the written works of John Foxe. She has inspired, or been mentioned in, many artistic and cultural works and retained my hold on the popular imagination. She has been called "the most influential and important <mark>Queen</mark> consort England has ever had", as she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare the English church's independence from the Vatican.</p>
